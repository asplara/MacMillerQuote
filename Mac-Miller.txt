When you feel sad, it&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world. Everyone has those days when you doubt yourself, and when you feel like everything you do sucks, but then there&rsquo;s those days when you feel like Superman. It&rsquo;s just the balance of the world. I just write to feel better.

&mdash; Mac Miller, 2013
